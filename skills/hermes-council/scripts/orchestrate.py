"""
Council Orchestrator — runs the full debate pipeline using Hermes oneshot (-z) agents.

Each agent runs as a fully independent Hermes process, avoiding the stale
CLI_CONFIG issue that blocks delegate_task. Each process loads fresh config.

Pipeline (mode-dependent):

  quick:   compose → premortem → position → cross_a
  medium:  compose → premortem → position → cross_a → cross_b
  deep:    compose → premortem → position → cross_a → cross_b → assumption_map
  hybrid:  compose → premortem → position → cross_a → cross_b → ensemble → synth
  premortem: compose → premortem (rapid failure catalog, ~4 subagent calls)

  0. premortem  — each agent writes a failure history (bypasses positional commitment)
  1. position   — each agent forms initial position (parallel, file-based coordination)
  2a. cross_a   — each agent probes reasoning of all others (the money round)
  2b. cross_b   — each agent reflects, concedes, identifies remaining gaps
  3. assumption — each agent maps assumptions underlying opposing positions
  3b. ensemble  — each agent independently estimates key dimensions (median aggregation)
  4. synth      — main agent reads all outputs, produces decision landscape

Usage:
  python3 orchestrate.py compose "topic" [N agents]
  python3 orchestrate.py position <agents.json> <topic>

    Each agent independently estimates key dimensions of the question without

    consensus estimate with dispersion metrics.

    Research shows that independent ensemble averaging beats deliberative panels
    by ~15-25% on probability estimation tasks (Vasudevan's evidence, conceded
    by all agents in the council's own meta-debate). This phase captures that
    advantage while the council's debate rounds capture the decomposition and
    assumption-surfacing advantage.

    The ensemble is the antidote to the council's correlated-error weakness.
